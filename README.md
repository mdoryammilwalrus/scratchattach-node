Scratch API wrapper with support for almost all site features - ported to NodeJS

This library can set cloud variables, follow Scratchers, post comments and do so much more! It has special features that make it easy to transmit data through cloud variables.

**Some functions require logging in to Scratch.**
**You also need to have NodeJS installed on your device.**
*Download NodeJS here if you don't have it: https://nodejs.org*

The project was made by TimMcCool for Python and ported to NodeJS by me
